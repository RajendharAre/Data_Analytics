# Innomatics Research Labs – Data Analytics Task

##  Project Overview
This project is part of the **Innomatics Research Labs Data Analytics Task**, where multiple datasets from different formats are combined and analyzed to extract meaningful business insights.

The task involves data loading, cleaning, merging, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and answering business-oriented questions using Python.

---

##  Datasets Used
- **orders.csv** – Transactional order data  
- **users.json** – User master data  
- **restaurants.sql** – Restaurant master data  

---

## Tools & Technologies
- Python  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- SQLite  
- Matplotlib  
- Google Colab  
- GitHub

##  Data Processing Steps
1. Loaded CSV, JSON, and SQL data into Pandas DataFrames  
2. Merged datasets using LEFT JOINs on:
   - `user_id`
   - `restaurant_id`
3. Created a final consolidated dataset  
4. Performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
5. Answered MCQs, numerical questions, and fill-in-the-blanks

##  Analysis Performed
- Order trends over time  
- Revenue analysis (city-wise, membership-wise, cuisine-wise)  
- User behavior analysis  
- Restaurant performance analysis  
- Gold vs Regular membership comparison
